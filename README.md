# Evaluating LLMs for Colonoscopy Preparation Assistance
This repository contains synthetic patient–AI Coach dialogues generated to evaluate the capabilities of frontier large language models (LLMs) in providing colonoscopy preparation support. See paper: .

## Background
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., and colonoscopy remains the gold standard for early detection and prevention. Many procedures are postponed due to inadequate bowel preparation, often caused by patients’ difficulty in understanding or following written prep instructions. Recent LLM advances offer the potential for interactive assistance in procedure preparation.
This project evaluates correctness and diversity of synthetic dialogues generated by multiple LLMs simulating both patients and AI Coaches.

## Dataset
**Models**:
* OpenAI: GPT-5, o3, GPT-4.1
* Meta: Llama 3.3 70B
* Mistral: Large-2411
  
**Size**: 250 dialogues per model

**Evaluation**: Dialogues were evaluated by DeepSeek-R1 for correctness in reference to prep instructions.
